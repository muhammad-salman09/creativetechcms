## installing

- Angular JS (latest version)
- Node JS (latest version available)
- MongoDB
- Mongoshell (compass)

## install npm pakages
Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:
```
- install npm
- start npm
```
- install angular-cli with ```npm install -g @angular/cli``` 
 for using form ```import {FormsModule} from '@angular/forms'``` in ```app.module.ts``` file.


The ```npm start``` command first compiles the application, then simultaneously ```re-compiles``` and runs the ```lite-server```. Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.
Shut it down manually with ```Ctrl-C```.
- You're ready to write your application.

## Running the Test

TypeScript unit-tests are usually in the ```src/app``` folder. Their filenames must end in ```.spec.ts.```
Look for the example ```src/app/app.component.spec.ts.``` Add more .spec.ts files as you wish; we configured karma to find them.
Run it with ```npm test``` 
That command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the karma test-runner. Both the compiler and the karma watch for (different) file changes.
Shut it down manually with ```Ctrl-C```.
Test-runner output appears in the terminal window. We can update our app and our tests in real-time, keeping a weather eye on the console for broken tests.
Karma is occasionally confused and it is often necessary to shut down its browser or even shut the command down ```(Ctrl-C)``` and restart it.
No worries; it's pretty quick.
